where I keep my docker setups

The goals of my docker setup are:

-to give me the nice zsh experience I have on my base os

-to allow me to mount my neovim config

I have good success just mounting any directory I'm interested in. When I make a new container I still have to run :UpdateRemotePlugins the first time I start neovim.
